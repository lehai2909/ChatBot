Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . __eou__ There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? __eou__ 200 dollars per week . __eou__ In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . __eou__ It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . __eou__ Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . __eou__ Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? __eou__ I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? __eou__ Twice a week for work and once for shopping . __eou__ In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . __eou__ That's true . Ok , I will think about it . __eou__\n",

It must be one of the famous local dishes . __eou__ Yes . It's a traditional dish . __eou__ And it must be very particular in cooking . __eou__ You are right , sir .

These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? __eou__ Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . __eou__ Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? __eou__ Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive .

But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . __eou__ So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . __eou__ I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ All right .

Chinese is no problem for Apple . __eou__ Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . __eou__ No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . __eou__ Well , thanks for your advice .

      "In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . __eou__ You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , \" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . \" __eou__ It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' __eou__\n",

      "Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . __eou__ You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . __eou__ What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? __eou__ I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... __eou__ And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . __eou__ Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . __eou__ Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport __eou__ Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . __eou__ I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . __eou__ Actually , he excels in it .

      "Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__ I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . __eou__ You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__ I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . __eou__ All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__ Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__\n",

They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . __eou__ That's good advice .

I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__ I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__ Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__ Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__\n",

      "I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? __eou__ For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . __eou__ Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__ Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__ Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . __eou__ There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . __eou__ You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? __eou__ Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . __eou__\n",

      "The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__ Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__ No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__ You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__ Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__ Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__ Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__ Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__ Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__\n",

      "In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__ Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! __eou__ Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . __eou__ Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . __eou__ Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . __eou__ What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . __eou__ Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . __eou__\n",

      "Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . __eou__ A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__\n",

      "Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning \" Thanks \" . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__\n",

      "What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink \" one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ Yes .

Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . __eou__ Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . __eou__ It's important to do proper exercises . __eou__ You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . __eou__ The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . __eou__ Sounds reasonable . __eou__ We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . __eou__ And fruits ! __eou__ Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . __eou__ I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? __eou__ Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood .

      "Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? __eou__ Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__ Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . __eou__ I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! __eou__ Really ? What's the series about ? __eou__ Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . __eou__ It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__ I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . __eou__ Really ? that's interesting ! __eou__ Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . __eou__ OK , I'll give it a go . __eou__\n",

      "Have you ever tried shopping online ? __eou__ No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . __eou__ That's right . Seeing is believing . __eou__ I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . __eou__ That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . __eou__ What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . __eou__ It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . __eou__ I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping . __eou__ Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__\n",

      "Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! __eou__ Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited . __eou__ He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . __eou__ And the host announced that he won it all ! __eou__\n",

      "Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? __eou__ Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . __eou__ Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . __eou__ That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . __eou__ But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . __eou__ Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . __eou__ No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . __eou__ And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . __eou__ The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . __eou__ I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . __eou__\n",

I buy most of my daily necessities online . __eou__ I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? __eou__ Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . __eou__ Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . __eou__ And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall . __eou__ Well , are there any other advantages ? __eou__ Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . __eou__ Are there many choices of online shopping ? __eou__ Sure .

      "A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” __eou__ Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . __eou__ I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? __eou__ The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? __eou__ Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . __eou__ It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? __eou__ Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” __eou__\n",

That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store .

That's not as bad as last time . __eou__ True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... __eou__ Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . __eou__ And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . __eou__ At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . __eou__ Stop interrupting me .

      "I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . __eou__ I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much .

By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . __eou__ We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . __eou__ That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? __eou__ Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? __eou__ I like the red one . What do they eat ? __eou__ You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . __eou__ Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . __eou__ That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . __eou__\n",

Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . __eou__ What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? __eou__ One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . __eou__ So I need plenty of space for this exercise . __eou__ Yes , you do .

I am craving some type of beef dish . __eou__ Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten . __eou__ I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ? __eou__ There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it . __eou__ Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food . __eou__ Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . __eou__ What about veggies ? __eou__ They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . __eou__ It all sounds exquisite !

      "Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__\n",

My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's \" chi \" . __eou__ But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself .

      "Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . __eou__ Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . __eou__ OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? __eou__ Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? __eou__ Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . __eou__ Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? __eou__ That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . __eou__ Let's see . The label says it's got \" attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . \" Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . __eou__ All right . What varietal is that ? __eou__ Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . __eou__ And you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ Perfect !

      "Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! __eou__\n",

I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants .

The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s .

What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? __eou__ There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however .

And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . __eou__ That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time . __eou__\n",

      "Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? __eou__ My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . __eou__ That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . __eou__ Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__ What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__ Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? __eou__ Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . __eou__ What do you require ? __eou__ A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . __eou__\n",

Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . __eou__ That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step .

Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__ May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . __eou__ When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__ That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__ As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . __eou__\n",

What's the difference ? __eou__ Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . __eou__ Why such a big difference ? __eou__ It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . __eou__ My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? __eou__ Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . __eou__ That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . __eou__\n",

I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . __eou__ Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . __eou__ Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . __eou__ You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__ So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? __eou__ Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . __eou__ Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . __eou__\n",

      "Mr Moon , how good to see you again . __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? __eou__ Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__ What if I exceed ? __eou__ If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__ Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do . __eou__\n",
      "\n",
      "After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . __eou__ Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? __eou__ It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . __eou__ So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? __eou__ First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . __eou__ OK , let's get the ball rolling on this . __eou__\n",

Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? __eou__ Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us .

I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__ That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . __eou__ And I can purchase that here ? __eou__ Yes .

You forgot your code , didn't you ? __eou__ How did you know ? __eou__ The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it . __eou__ Oh . But can I have my card back now ? __eou__ Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank . __eou__\n",

The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . __eou__ So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? __eou__ That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . __eou__ I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before !

As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed . __eou__\n",

The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . __eou__ Is there any flexibility on that ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . __eou__ OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . __eou__ Not a problem , Sir .

OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__ And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__ For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more .

Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . __eou__ I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . __eou__ Quite right .

However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . __eou__ Then please cover W . P .

What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__ Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__ That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . __eou__\n",

      "Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . __eou__ What is it , Mrs . Wang ? __eou__ It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . __eou__ Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? __eou__ Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . __eou__ Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . __eou__ The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . __eou__ As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . __eou__ I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . __eou__ The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . __eou__ We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . __eou__ That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . __eou__ To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . __eou__ Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . __eou__ Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . __eou__\n",

You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . __eou__ A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . __eou__ The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . __eou__ Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % . __eou__\n",

What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . __eou__ Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__ But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__ That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . __eou__ But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . __eou__ But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . __eou__ But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__ I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . __eou__\n",

They will give you a rough idea about our products . __eou__ I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . __eou__ To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices .

You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__ The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__\n",

Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . __eou__ Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . __eou__ Good . Well , Mr .

Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . __eou__ Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . __eou__ Thank you , Ms Chi .

We have never done business on such terms . __eou__ But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__ We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__ That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__ Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__ If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__ Thank you .

I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__ I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . __eou__ As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . __eou__ If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . __eou__ I am sorry . __eou__ What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ I said by the middle of Oct .

It's the normal terms of payment in international business . __eou__ Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . __eou__ You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee .

You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ Good , that's all then . __eou__ Good . __eou__\n",

      "I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . __eou__ Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . __eou__ Do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__ Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . __eou__ Do you keep a stock of these things ? __eou__ In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . __eou__ That is , your commission . __eou__ Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . __eou__ The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? __eou__ We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . __eou__ We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... __eou__ Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? __eou__ Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . __eou__ Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . __eou__ Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . __eou__ Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? __eou__ Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . __eou__ All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . __eou__ Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . __eou__\n",

The gap is too great . __eou__ I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? __eou__ What is your proposal ? __eou__ Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . __eou__ Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . __eou__ What would you suggest ? __eou__ The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . __eou__ That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . __eou__ You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . __eou__ I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . __eou__ Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . __eou__ Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? __eou__ Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to .

The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__ We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . __eou__ I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers .

As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . __eou__ We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . __eou__ I'll come to that . My proposal is __eou__ As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? __eou__ Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? __eou__ Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . __eou__ You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . __eou__ On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . __eou__ Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . __eou__\n",

      "How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? __eou__ We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__ That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? __eou__ Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__ Is that including tax ? __eou__ No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__ How much is your profit margin then ? __eou__ Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . __eou__\n",

You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__ We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__ The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__ Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__ When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__ How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__ Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__ I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet .

We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . __eou__ Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . __eou__ So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . __eou__ The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? __eou__ To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . __eou__ That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . __eou__ Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? __eou__ Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? __eou__ Good . Friday morning at 9 . __eou__\n",

They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__ So I didn't miss by much then . __eou__ No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time .

We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light .

It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . __eou__ Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . __eou__ Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? __eou__ Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . __eou__ I see . __eou__\n",

      "To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . __eou__ Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? __eou__ A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__ When will that be ? __eou__ Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . __eou__ That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . __eou__ Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . __eou__ By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? __eou__ Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . __eou__ If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . __eou__ Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . __eou__ All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . __eou__ We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . __eou__\n",

      "Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . __eou__ Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__ That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . __eou__ Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__ Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__ Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__ Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__ Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__ Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__ All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . __eou__\n",

      "That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . __eou__ Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__ 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__ Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__ Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__ Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? __eou__ All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__ Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? __eou__ Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__ That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__\n",

      "I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__ Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__ I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__ In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__ Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . __eou__\n",

      "Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? __eou__ Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__ Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__ Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ What about the outer packing ? __eou__ We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Cartons ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__ The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__ Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__ No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__ Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__ Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__ Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__ But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . __eou__ If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__ I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__ I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . __eou__ We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__ Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__ Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . __eou__\n",

      "Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? __eou__ I don't think we can . __eou__ Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__ By the middle of October , I think . __eou__ That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__ But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__ Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__ I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__ That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__ You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__ But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . __eou__ All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . __eou__\n",

      "Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__ Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__\n",

      "It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . __eou__ And that is ? __eou__ How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? __eou__ I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . __eou__ It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . __eou__ I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? __eou__ Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . __eou__ Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . __eou__ It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? __eou__ We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . __eou__\n",

      "Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__ It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__ That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! __eou__\n",

      "Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . __eou__ Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? __eou__ I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . __eou__ I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . __eou__ I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__ Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__ In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__ It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__ Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__ If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__ It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__ We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . __eou__ If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . __eou__ That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that __eou__\n",

I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea .

Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . __eou__ Which is the best way ? __eou__ It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money .

Can I send it more quickly ? __eou__ Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . __eou__ And how long do those take ? __eou__ Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . __eou__ I see .

Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? __eou__ Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? __eou__ For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . __eou__ So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might __eou__ We do value your business .

I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . __eou__ Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? __eou__ Eventually I did get to a real person .

You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . __eou__ And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? __eou__ Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__ Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__ As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__ That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . __eou__ It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . __eou__ So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__ Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__ You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . __eou__ No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__ In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . __eou__ I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . __eou__ Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . __eou__ I understand , Ma'am . __eou__ And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__ It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__ I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . __eou__ Well . __eou__ You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . __eou__ Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free .

I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . __eou__ Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? __eou__ I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . __eou__ Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? __eou__ So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . __eou__ That's amazing ! Really ?

The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__ What are bar vouchers ? __eou__ Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__ But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__ That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . __eou__ So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet .
